# Frontend Mentor - Pricing component with toggle solution

This is a solution to the [Pricing component with toggle challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pricing-component-with-toggle-8vPwRMIC). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The goal of this challenge was to recreate the design as close as possible.
Also I've decided to challenge myself adding all the price plans information dynamically, and not use CSS to change them (as suggested in the challenge website).
